Easily change the type of your cabins in Stardew Valley by pressing the configurable hotkey. (default: U)

Update Features:

     * Being able to change any building type (Greenhouse, Shops, etc) has been fixed, you can now only change Cabins so you don't damage your town/farm.
     * When using the original mod on the newer client it would create "extra" buildings, this has been patched.
     * Newer building types have been added to the list.


How to Install:

    * Install SMAPI: https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2400ï»¿
    * Place the "ChangeCabinType" folder inside the "Mods" folder in your Stardew Valley game directory.
    * Launch the game via "StardewModdingAPI.exe" and enjoy.


How to Use:

    * Mouse over any cabin (except the main farm house)
    * Press the hotkey (default is U), it will cycle through the list of available building types.


Settings:

    * Edit the "config.json" file in the "ChangeCabinType" folder to set your options.
